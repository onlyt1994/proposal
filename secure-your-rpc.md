# SECURE YOUR RPC

Some projects will ask you to setup https instead of http. Therefore, I'm here to solve this problem for you

For now, I just setup three ports for DYM RollApp. I will update my code to let you setup your port yourself for rpc or rest endpoint

I wrote the very detailed docs to setup your server with ports 26657 -> rpc, 1317 -> rest endpoint, 8545 -> rpc endpoint

Please follow the instruction. If you have questions, please ask me at: [https://t.me/airdrops1994](https://t.me/airdrops1994)
