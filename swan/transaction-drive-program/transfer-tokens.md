# Transfer tokens

This section will be very similar to you guys.

I will guide you to send your token you created in [Deploying Smart Contracts](broken-reference)

### Add your token into metamask <a href="#add-your-token-into-metamask" id="add-your-token-into-metamask"></a>

Copy your `contract address` in log Remix IDE

Go to [Import SWAN Token](https://about/swan/prepare-your-testnet-journey#import-swan-token), follow instruction there with the `contract address` instead of SWAN Token

Then you will see your token in your wallet

Click `Send` then choose that Token. Next, you need an `address` to send. Get my address to test yours `0x9a2E760C6B7F3Dd3E3e165226C9127d5E809bC96`

Fill your amount of token then send and see the magic. You just created your own token. Congratulation!!!
