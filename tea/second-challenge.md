The Challenge is only available for anyone who get the banner on the top of website "Your tea is served! You're on our list of early access users and get to test new functionality..."

Base on my experience in this challenge, there are some challenges being finished as below image

### Claim & stake <a href="#claim-and-stake" id="claim-and-stake"></a>

Go to `My Oss Projects` tab, you will see `Unclaimed Rewards` column at your Oss project

If it's greater than 0, click on `three dots` then `Claim Rewards`

Chose `Claim & Stake` then Stake all Rewards and Confirm

You have to wait a little minutes to get 100 points

This Challenge will affect for all contributors in your OSS project. It means all contributors will get 100 points

### Stake to OSS project <a href="#stake-to-oss-project" id="stake-to-oss-project"></a>

Go back the home, then click `Stake TEA` to stake your TEA token to some projects

If you don't have the project to stake, search for `react-random-number-generator` to stake

Then you can stake any TEA you want, I think I recommend that you stake 1000 TEA
